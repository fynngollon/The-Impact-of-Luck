# The Impact of Luck
An afternoon project which helps to understand how much impact luck has in our lives even under the assumption of a very high skill dependency. Real-world example of NASA astronauts applicants (48 picked out of 18300 with 5% luck as a factor).

_Inspired by: Veritasium, "Is Success Luck or Hard Work?". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I_
